# GAGCN
GAGCN: Generative Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation<br />

Key Contributions:<br />
1. Proposed GCN with adversarial learning scheme in 3D point cloud segmentation
2. Utilized Embedding loss for adversarial learning
3. Proposed an effective way for convolution in graph or point cloud representation<br />
